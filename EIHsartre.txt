"Atheistic existentialism, of which I am a representative, declares with greater consistency
that if God does not exist there is at least one being whose existence comes before its
essence, a being which exists before it can be defined by any conception of it. That being
is man or, as Heidegger has it, the human reality. What do we mean by saying that
existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself,
surges up in the world â€” and defines himself afterwards. If man as the existentialist sees
him is not definable, it is because to begin with he is nothing."
